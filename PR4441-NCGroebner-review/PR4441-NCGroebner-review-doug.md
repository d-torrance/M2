# PR #4441 — Tests: NCGroebner — Doug's review

Files: `e/unit-tests/NCGroebnerTest.cpp`. With Mike S.
Details: `PR4441-NCGroebner-review-claude.md`.

## Points for the PR

1. **Suffix-tree tests crash (§11, #4701).** On Linux, `DISABLED_suffixtree1` segfaults instead of failing. Valgrind shows a use-after-free in `SuffixTree::splitArc` in both tests, so #4701's "missing overlaps" are probably freed-memory reads. The issue and both test comments should say so.
2. **`ASSERT_EQ` hides the rest of the suffix-tree tests (§5).** The later blocks (596 overlaps, superwords, left overlaps) have never run; use `EXPECT_EQ`.
3. **Broken Emacs footer.** clang-format merged `compile-command`, `indent-tabs-mode` and `End:` into two lines (`:888–889`).
4. **`NCReduction.tryit` is now a duplicate.** It repeats two other heap tests, and `tryOutMathicCode` is left with no callers.
5. **`MemoryBlock.tryit` doesn't test shrinking.** Values are written only after `shrinkLastAllocate`, and the address isn't checked. So it can't catch the data loss or move that F4's two callers would suffer, even though its opener claims it does.
6. **Deleted clue for #4700 (§6).** "This doesn't give an error unless you use *all* the terms" was dropped; it belongs above the disabled test.
7. **A TODO became an unchecked statement (§13).** The heft/length offset comment in `spairs` (`:369`); its checks are also `EXPECT_TRUE(a && b)` with no values reported.
8. **`NCGroebner.sorting` tests `std::map` (minor).** It asserts `std::pair` ordering, not engine behavior.
9. **`EXPECT_TRUE(f == h)` (minor, §5).** Three comparisons still don't print their values.

## For Doug / Mike only

10. **Ask Mike** whether the suffix-tree expected values are still right, and whether unused experimental code should have disabled tests and an issue at all.
11. `MonomialOrdering.create` is misplaced in this file; a candidate to move later.

## Good

12. The heap tests were folded into two shared helpers that assert instead of printing. `MemoryBlock` now checks that later allocations don't overwrite earlier ones. The leaks are gone, and `WordTable`/`SuffixTree` share one Sklyanin template.

## Status

13. Built with Autotools on Ubuntu 24.04. The 19 enabled tests pass, also shuffled; the full suite has 879 passed, 4 skipped and 26 disabled. Of the 3 disabled tests, 2 fail on their assertions and 1 segfaults. CMake and coverage were not run.
