highlight.js files
===================

[highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) is a JavaScript syntax highlighter
with language auto-detection and zero dependencies.

It is used for syntax highlighting the Macaulay2 documentation.  There are two
files included in the `Style` package from highlight.js:

* `highlight.css` - This is essentially `src/styles/default.css` with
  one line commented out (the `background` property for all tags with the
  `hljs` class).

* `highlight.js` - After copying `macaulay2.js` (generated by
  `M2/Macaulay2/editors/make-M2-symbols.m2` from the Macaulay2 repository)
  into `extra/highlightjs-macaulay2/src/languages`, this was generated by
  running:

  ```
  node tools/build.js -n macaulay2 -t browser
  ```
